# TicTacToe
My implementation of TicTacToe that contains two classes: Board.java and TicTacToe.java

Board.java contains the implimintation of the grid and menu; and has methods, such as newgame (configures a new game, also added to the menu), check (checks if the game is done or still goes on), gameover (returns if there is a winner of noone won or the game did not finish yet).

TicTacToe.java configured the board at the very beginning.
